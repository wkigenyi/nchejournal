        title:`Role of Higher Education Growth in Enhancing Economic Growth, Innovation
    Advancement and Technological Progress in Uganda (1970–2014)`,
        abstract:`We examine the role of growth in higher education in enhancing economic growth,
        innovation advancement and technological progress in Uganda during the 1970 to
        2014 period. Higher education is measured by the higher (tertiary) education gross
        enrolment ratio (GER). The major hypothesis of the study is that “Higher education
        growth enhances economic growth, innovation advancement and technical
        progress”. The study is important because Uganda still has low levels of higher
        education GER, innovation and technology. Data set employed in the empirical
        analyses was obtained from the United Nations statistics database and analyzed
        using the generalised least squares (GLS) technique. First, we find that a 1% increase
        in higher education GER growth had the potential of causing economic growth,
        innovation advancement, technological progress and total factor (TF) to increase by
        0.82, 0.10, 0.27 and 0.56%, respectively, during the given period. Second, empirical
        evidence shows that a 1% increase in economic growth, innovation advancement,
        technological progress and TF the potential of causing higher education GER
        growth to increase by 1.08, 5.02, 1.36 and 1.42%, respectively, during the given
        period. Third, over the given period, a 1% growth in innovation, technical progress`,

        title:`Building Educational Research Capacity: Challenges and Opportunities from the
        Perspectives of Faculty Staff of Selected Private Universities in Uganda`,
        abstract:`This article argues that educational research in Uganda is facing severe glitches,
        such as low research capacity. Most private universities seem to be more focused
        on their day-to-day survival than identifying their research-specific needs and
        engaging in quality research activities. Issues of research capacity-building remain
        a major concern amid a lack of resources and institutional environments in which
        academics work. Capacity-building and research engagements would help to
        strengthen strategic planning and influencing policy. Hence, this study fills this
        gap. Specifically, it explores the perceptions and experiences of academic staff
        regarding research capacity-building. The study identifies the challenges that
        hamper educational research and capacity-building opportunities associated with
        the development of research capacities as perceived by a sample of staff members
        in the identified institutions. To achieve this objective, a qualitative research design
        was adopted using focus group interviews to collect data from a sample of staff. In
        total, 12 focus group discussions were conducted with between 8–10 persons per
        group. Rank ordering of responses on specific issues was done during data analysis.
        The findings showed that the major factors responsible for low research output
        include capacity-building gaps, lack of financial resources, difficulty in identifying
        specific calls for abstracts and manuscripts, work overload for faculty staff, limited
        research writing skills, and bad experiences during previous research engagements,
        as presented and discussed below. Based on the findings, we make the following
        recommendations. First, the government should earmark a significant amount in
        the national budget for research and innovation that institutions in Uganda can
        easily access, including private academic institutions. Second, institutions should
        continuously engage their staff regarding research and improve their research
        capacity through training, workshops and symposiums.`,

    {id:3,title:`Research Management and Research Productivity among Lecturers at Kyambogo
    University, Uganda`,authors:[`Moses Kanaabi`, `George Wilson Kasule`, `Philip Owino`],
    abstract:`Management is a critical factor for the performance of every organisation. Research
    management has thus become highly professionalised, with universities instituting
    systems, practices and structures to manage their research function. Universities
    also appoint high-level academic and administrative staff to coordinate, oversee
    and promote research activities to meet their research objectives. However, most
    universities in Uganda, Kyambogo, inclusive have not instituted functional
    research management. They still lack well-managed formal research teams,
    collaborations and partnerships, besides effective research training programmes,
    research monitoring, research ethical committees, journals and university press.
    This mixed-method study was, therefore, intended to investigate the effect of
    research management on research productivity at Kyambogo University. The
    study used self-administered questionnaires to collect quantitative data from 127
    PhD-holding lecturers and interviews with seven key informers. The study applied
    structural equation modelling to analyse quantitative data and content thematic
    analysis for qualitative data. The results revealed weak research management in the
    university, and a positive and significant effect of research management on research
    productivity, with a Beta value of .402 and a P value of .000. The results imply that
    the near-absence of research management systems, practices and structures prevents
    lecturers from conducting research. The study thus recommended the institution of
    supportive research management systems, practices and structures in the university
    for increased research output among their academic staff.`,

    title:`Policy Support and Research Productivity among Lecturers in Ugandan Public
    Universities: Case of Kyambogo University`,
    authors:[`Moses Kanaabi`, `George Wilson Kasule`, `Philip Owino`],
    abstract:`In today’s competitive global higher education market, research productivity
    has become a dominant criterion for determining the university’s effectiveness.
    Besides, high-quality research benefits individual academics, their departments
    and institutions by raising their global rankings, recognition and prestige, with
    multiple accruing benefits. However, in a situation of low research output from
    Ugandan public universities, there is urgent need for increased organisational
    support to facilitate lecturers in conducting this cardinal university function. This
    mixed-methods study was, therefore, intended to evaluate the effect of the university
    research policy on lecturers’ research productivity in Kyambogo University, one
    of the biggest but relatively new public universities in Uganda. A correlational
    survey design guided the study using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.
    A sample of 127 PhD-holding lecturers, three faculty deans, Directors of Quality
    Assurance and Human Resource, the University Bursar and the University Librarian
    participated in the study. Data collected using questionnaire and interviews were
    analysed using structural equation modelling for quantitative data while thematic
    content analysis was used for qualitative data to establish relationships between the
    variables. The findings revealed moderate policy support for research productivity
    with a mean value of 3.07, a positive and significant relationship between the
    variables with a beta value of .416 and a P-value of .000. The study recommended
    the formulation and implementation of favouring and supportive policies to increase
    lecturers’ research productivity in public universities. The findings will likely be
    used to inform university managers on generating practical policy interventions
    to boost research productivity among lecturers in public universities.`,

    abstract:`University rankings have become a standard criterion of characterising higher
    institutions of learning irrespective of their specialisation, be it social sciences,
    natural sciences, health sciences or technology. The most highly ranked institutions
    worldwide are based on the same criteria despite the area of specialty and the
    geographical location. Higher institutional rankings are mainly based on pedagogy,
    strategic placement, research output in terms of publications, academic staff-student
    ratio, international linkage or partnerships, management of technological resources,
    and the existing human and infrastructural resources. This article attempts to
    address the possible ways to enhance research in developing institutions with a
    case study of Busitema University, Uganda. We propose the Busitema University
    Research (BUR) Model that can be used to analyse why the performance of higher
    institutions of learning (HIL) should be ranked based on the criteria of institutional
    research output (IRO). A survey was also conducted from 29 respondents and the
    data was analysed using Spreadsheet. From the generated results, it was established
    that the quality of academic staff highly determines the research output and thereby
    the increased university ranking. The results also formed the basis of the BUR Model
    development. The developed model will further be tested during a comprehensive
    study involving different HIL, especially in computing their respective institutional
    research index and rankings.`,
