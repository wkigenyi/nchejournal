        title:`Role of Higher Education Growth in Enhancing Economic Growth, Innovation
    Advancement and Technological Progress in Uganda (1970–2014)`,
        abstract:`We examine the role of growth in higher education in enhancing economic growth,
        innovation advancement and technological progress in Uganda during the 1970 to
        2014 period. Higher education is measured by the higher (tertiary) education gross
        enrolment ratio (GER). The major hypothesis of the study is that “Higher education
        growth enhances economic growth, innovation advancement and technical
        progress”. The study is important because Uganda still has low levels of higher
        education GER, innovation and technology. Data set employed in the empirical
        analyses was obtained from the United Nations statistics database and analyzed
        using the generalised least squares (GLS) technique. First, we find that a 1% increase
        in higher education GER growth had the potential of causing economic growth,
        innovation advancement, technological progress and total factor (TF) to increase by
        0.82, 0.10, 0.27 and 0.56%, respectively, during the given period. Second, empirical
        evidence shows that a 1% increase in economic growth, innovation advancement,
        technological progress and TF the potential of causing higher education GER
        growth to increase by 1.08, 5.02, 1.36 and 1.42%, respectively, during the given
        period. Third, over the given period, a 1% growth in innovation, technical progress`,

        title:`Building Educational Research Capacity: Challenges and Opportunities from the
        Perspectives of Faculty Staff of Selected Private Universities in Uganda`,
        abstract:`This article argues that educational research in Uganda is facing severe glitches,
        such as low research capacity. Most private universities seem to be more focused
        on their day-to-day survival than identifying their research-specific needs and
        engaging in quality research activities. Issues of research capacity-building remain
        a major concern amid a lack of resources and institutional environments in which
        academics work. Capacity-building and research engagements would help to
        strengthen strategic planning and influencing policy. Hence, this study fills this
        gap. Specifically, it explores the perceptions and experiences of academic staff
        regarding research capacity-building. The study identifies the challenges that
        hamper educational research and capacity-building opportunities associated with
        the development of research capacities as perceived by a sample of staff members
        in the identified institutions. To achieve this objective, a qualitative research design
        was adopted using focus group interviews to collect data from a sample of staff. In
        total, 12 focus group discussions were conducted with between 8–10 persons per
        group. Rank ordering of responses on specific issues was done during data analysis.
        The findings showed that the major factors responsible for low research output
        include capacity-building gaps, lack of financial resources, difficulty in identifying
        specific calls for abstracts and manuscripts, work overload for faculty staff, limited
        research writing skills, and bad experiences during previous research engagements,
        as presented and discussed below. Based on the findings, we make the following
        recommendations. First, the government should earmark a significant amount in
        the national budget for research and innovation that institutions in Uganda can
        easily access, including private academic institutions. Second, institutions should
        continuously engage their staff regarding research and improve their research
        capacity through training, workshops and symposiums.`,

    University, Uganda`,
        authors:[`Moses Kanaabi`, `George Wilson Kasule`, `Philip Owino`],
        abstract:`Management is a critical factor for the performance of every organisation. Research
    management has thus become highly professionalised, with universities instituting
    systems, practices and structures to manage their research function. Universities
    also appoint high-level academic and administrative staff to coordinate, oversee
    and promote research activities to meet their research objectives. However, most
    universities in Uganda, Kyambogo, inclusive have not instituted functional
    research management. They still lack well-managed formal research teams,
    collaborations and partnerships, besides effective research training programmes,
    research monitoring, research ethical committees, journals and university press.
    This mixed-method study was, therefore, intended to investigate the effect of
    research management on research productivity at Kyambogo University. The
    study used self-administered questionnaires to collect quantitative data from 127
    PhD-holding lecturers and interviews with seven key informers. The study applied
    structural equation modelling to analyse quantitative data and content thematic
    analysis for qualitative data. The results revealed weak research management in the
    university, and a positive and significant effect of research management on research
    productivity, with a Beta value of .402 and a P value of .000. The results imply that
    the near-absence of research management systems, practices and structures prevents
    lecturers from conducting research. The study thus recommended the institution of
    supportive research management systems, practices and structures in the university
    for increased research output among their academic staff.`,

    abstract:`In today’s competitive global higher education market, research productivity
    has become a dominant criterion for determining the university’s effectiveness.
    Besides, high-quality research benefits individual academics, their departments
    and institutions by raising their global rankings, recognition and prestige, with
    multiple accruing benefits. However, in a situation of low research output from
    Ugandan public universities, there is urgent need for increased organisational
    support to facilitate lecturers in conducting this cardinal university function. This
    mixed-methods study was, therefore, intended to evaluate the effect of the university
    research policy on lecturers’ research productivity in Kyambogo University, one
    of the biggest but relatively new public universities in Uganda. A correlational
    survey design guided the study using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.
    A sample of 127 PhD-holding lecturers, three faculty deans, Directors of Quality
    Assurance and Human Resource, the University Bursar and the University Librarian
    participated in the study. Data collected using questionnaire and interviews were
    analysed using structural equation modelling for quantitative data while thematic
    content analysis was used for qualitative data to establish relationships between the
    variables. The findings revealed moderate policy support for research productivity
    with a mean value of 3.07, a positive and significant relationship between the

    used to inform university managers on generating practical policy interventions
    to boost research productivity among lecturers in public universities.`,

    abstract:`University rankings have become a standard criterion of characterising higher
    institutions of learning irrespective of their specialisation, be it social sciences,
    natural sciences, health sciences or technology. The most highly ranked institutions
    worldwide are based on the same criteria despite the area of specialty and the
    geographical location. Higher institutional rankings are mainly based on pedagogy,
    strategic placement, research output in terms of publications, academic staff-student
    ratio, international linkage or partnerships, management of technological resources,
    and the existing human and infrastructural resources. This article attempts to
    address the possible ways to enhance research in developing institutions with a
    case study of Busitema University, Uganda. We propose the Busitema University
    Research (BUR) Model that can be used to analyse why the performance of higher
    institutions of learning (HIL) should be ranked based on the criteria of institutional
    research output (IRO). A survey was also conducted from 29 respondents and the
    data was analysed using Spreadsheet. From the generated results, it was established
    that the quality of academic staff highly determines the research output and thereby
    the increased university ranking. The results also formed the basis of the BUR Model
    development. The developed model will further be tested during a comprehensive
    study involving different HIL, especially in computing their respective institutional

    abstract:`The study aimed at university sustainability development and the management
    of academic staff in Uganda. The sample comprised 80 respondents, including
    the teachers, heads of department and top managers in the universities. Data
    was analysed using one-way ANOVA by way of Excel statistical data analysis.
    Qualitative data was analysed using descriptions in themes deciphered in the
    course of the study. The majority of the academic staff lacked adequate knowledge
    about what was required of them in connection with university sustainability
    development. There was a significant relationship between university sustainability
    development and the management of academic staff in Uganda. It was concluded
    that many universities do not promote cross-campus collaborations that connect
    campus administration and students, which has resulted in inadequacy of funds
    to sufficiently train and manage staff. The study concluded that the majority
    of universities are still young in their sustainability effort of fully engaging the
    academic staff in a number of planned activities. It was also concluded that the
    majority of the academic staff are hesitant to get involved in university sustainability
    development due to lack of equity accorded to some of the staff. There is need to
    strengthen training of the academic staff in all areas that the universities feel are
    appropriate in order to greatly maintain and boost its sustainability development.
    There is also need to encourage a bottom-top approach for effective and sufficient
    communication and to provide appropriate and well-informed criteria to everyone
    on the mechanism used to reward the best academic staff as a way of increasing
    the positive impact of university sustainability development.`,

    authors:[`Margaret Stella Ujeyo`, `Rovincer Najjuma`, `Ronald Bisaso`],
    abstract:`Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) play an important role in
    Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), one of the multiple approaches
    advanced in the last two decades to address the global sustainability crisis. The
    role of higher education, especially as a main driver of change, in ameliorating the
    immense sustainability challenges is widely acknowledged. Educators in higher
    education institutions must strategically engage in profound transformative
    programmatic, pedagogical and organisational shifts in order to play this role.
    ICTs are important in enabling educators to make the necessary modifications to
    effectively promote themes, skills, knowledge, values and attitudes in learners
    that will foster sustainable development. This study adopted a concurrent mixed
    strategy to investigate the use of ICT in the implementation of ESD practices by
    academic staff of Busitema University in Uganda. It sought to find out the dominant
    ICT activities that staff used for implementing particular ESD practices. The sample
    consisted of 134 academic staff and students selected using simple random and
    purposive sampling. The study employed a questionnaire, interview and focus
    group guides as primary data collection instruments. The results point to a low level
    of ICT use, with the dominant ICT activities being of communication and sharing information, information creation and management, which did not add much value
    to the educational experiences of the learners in ESD. The study recommends staff
    training in ICT skills to address the challenge that comes with the use of new digital
    technologies, addressing the issues of access to ICTs and internet infrastructure.`,

    abstract:`The purpose of this study was to find out the relationship between employee
    engagement and job performance among university academic staff. The study,
    conducted at Makerere University, was guided by questions on the levels of
    engagement and performance among academic staff. A null hypothesis on the
    significance of employee engagement and job performance was also stated for
    investigation. The population of the study was comprised of 485 academic staff
    from10 different schools. A sample of 136 respondents was reached using a selfadministered
    questionnaire containing closed-ended items along a Likert scale as
    well as open-ended questions. Analysis was done using the Statistical Package for
    Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 by way of sums, means, frequencies, percentages
    and a bivariate, Pearson correlation coefficient. The findings, based on percentages
    and in agreement with statements, revealed that both employee engagement and
    job performance levels were high. There was a positive significant relationship
    between employee engagement and job performance (r=.391, p<0.05). The null
    hypothesis was rejected, meaning that engagement levels impact on performance.
    The recommendations, basing on the findings, focused on central and section
    managers developing strategies to heighten engagement levels in order to improve
    performance. This includes timely disbursement of financial and non-financial
    rewards, involvement of staff in decision, proper management of performance

    relationship between satisfaction with HRMPs and the job performance of academic
    staff in public universities in Uganda. The study comprised a sample of 198 from
    a population of 406 full-time academic staff of Kyambogo University. Data was
    collected using a questionnaire and analysed using SPSS for descriptive analysis
    and SmartPLS for Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Descriptive results showed
    that teaching performance was high while research and publication and community
    service performance were moderate. The results revealed that satisfaction with
    placement, development, engagement and talent retention HRMPs was moderate
    while satisfaction with human resource (HR) recruitment was slightly high.
    Overall, job performance was high while satisfaction with HRMPs was moderate.
    SEM revealed that while HR recruitment practices and placement had a positive
    significant influence on job performance, the influence of HR development,
    retention and engagement practices was insignificant. It was concluded that high
    and moderate satisfaction of academic staff with HR recruitment and placement,
    respectively, is imperative for their job performance. However, moderate satisfaction
    with HR development, engagement and talent retention practices impedes job
    performance of academic staff. This study recommended that university managers
    should ensure that HR recruitment and placement practices implemented provide
    satisfaction to academic staff. University managers should also ensure that
    satisfying HR development, engagement and talent retention are designed and

    to the satisfaction of students and other stakeholders. This study examined whether
    talent management strategies employed by the universities were a game changer for

    the study tested whether talent management in terms of talent attraction, talent
    development and talent retention had a relationship with work engagement of the

    abstract:`Keeping in close touch with a research supervisor is often vital for any university
    student. Unfortunately, this is hardly possible during the period of a pandemic. In
    this study, we explored the supervisory challenges that the doctoral students and
    their research supervisors at a school in a premier university in Uganda experienced
    and the coping strategies they utilised during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were
    provoked to undertake the study due to the persistent undocumented complaints
    from graduate students about their inability to get in touch with their research
    supervisors because of the closure of the university that was brought about by
    the pandemic. Taking the interpretive approach, we used a phenomenological
    research design and collected data by interviewing PhD students and their research
    supervisors, whom we purposively selected. We analysed the data using the
    thematic content analysis technique that we based on the factors influencing doctoral
    research supervision, namely student factors, supervisor factors and institutional
    factors. Our study findings revealed key research supervisory challenges. At
    the students’ level, we found loneliness, ICT challenges, unexpected study costs
    and family disturbances. While at the supervisor’s level, we found inadequate
    supervisor support and ineffective communication. Yet at the institutional level,
    we noted unclear institutional research policies and ineffective communication. We
    therefore concluded that several supervisory challenges negatively affected the
    students’ doctoral studies during the pandemic. However, there were varied but
    unclear strategies participants utilised to address these challenges. Hence, we
    recommend to university leaders to formulate clear institutional graduate training
    strategies for mitigating disruptions occasioned by any future pandemic.`,

    Satisfaction in the Context of Universities in Uganda.`,
    abstract:`Student satisfaction (SS) is one of the strategic tools for a university in a competitive
    environment. Hence the need to investigate SS in universities. The aim of our study
    was to use the European Customer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) model to examine
    SS in universities in Uganda. The ECSI model suggests that SS is dependent on
    university image (UI), student expectations (SE), service quality of infrastructure
    and tangible service elements (SQITSE), service quality of people and processes
    (SQPP) and perceived value of investment (PVI). The ECSI model further suggests
    that PVI is dependent on UI, SE, SQITSE and SQPP. It also suggests that student
    loyalty (SL) is dependent on UI, SS and SQPP and finally that SE is dependent on
    UI. We designed a self-administered questionnaire on those constructs and had a
    sample of 704 students from seven universities in Uganda respond to it. We analysed
    our data using linear regression. Our findings gave support to the ECSI model in
    examining SS. We established that all the relationships among the constructs in the

    abstract:`In this paper, we investigate the teaching of science subjects before and after the
    lockdown and explore the factors that affect students’ confidence in passing national
    examinations. The research was carried out in the districts of the Kigezi region in
    Uganda, where 435 students from 12 schools and 60 science teachers provided both
    qualitative and quantitative data on the state of science education before, during
    and post the Covid-19-induced lockdown through interviews and questionnaires.
    Multiple regression analysis was performed to establish the relationship between
    syllabus coverage, practical coverage, likability of the science subjects, and
    confidence in passing both school and national examinations. We note that poor
    syllabus coverage and lack of adequate practical time are often blamed for the poor
    pass rates in science subjects in secondary schools in Uganda, but this research
    indicates that blaming these two alone is simplistic at best. Our results show that
    although the two factors are important to students by themselves, they are not the
    only determinants of students’ confidence in success in national examinations. We
    show that subject likability is an indispensable determinant of students’ confidence
    in passing science subjects in national examinations, and together with practical
    teaching as well as syllabus coverage, a winning formula for improving confidence
    in passing and ultimately enrolment is obtained. From this, we conclude that improving students’ attitude and perception of science should be emphasized as
    much as advocacy for practical teaching and completion of the syllabus in time.
    This will improve students’ perception and performance in the sciences with the
    overall effect of boosting retention rates in STEM subjects.`,

    the universality of knowledge. These findings reinforced the earlier research that
    proposed that the above aspects are critical in the IoC and can act as benchmarks to
    guide further work in the direction of the university’s internationalisation agenda.
    No earlier works had similar results, at least in the context of the Global South
    where this study was conducted. Further studies need to involve other actors in
    higher education to explore more fully the notion of IoC to explain better the basis
    of students’ perceptions and experiences of IoC reported in this study.
