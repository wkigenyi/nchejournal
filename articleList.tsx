        title:`Role of Higher Education Growth in Enhancing Economic Growth, Innovation
    Advancement and Technological Progress in Uganda (1970–2014)`,
        abstract:`We examine the role of growth in higher education in enhancing economic growth,
        innovation advancement and technological progress in Uganda during the 1970 to
        2014 period. Higher education is measured by the higher (tertiary) education gross
        enrolment ratio (GER). The major hypothesis of the study is that “Higher education
        growth enhances economic growth, innovation advancement and technical
        progress”. The study is important because Uganda still has low levels of higher
        education GER, innovation and technology. Data set employed in the empirical
        analyses was obtained from the United Nations statistics database and analyzed
        using the generalised least squares (GLS) technique. First, we find that a 1% increase
        in higher education GER growth had the potential of causing economic growth,
        innovation advancement, technological progress and total factor (TF) to increase by
        0.82, 0.10, 0.27 and 0.56%, respectively, during the given period. Second, empirical
        evidence shows that a 1% increase in economic growth, innovation advancement,
        technological progress and TF the potential of causing higher education GER
        growth to increase by 1.08, 5.02, 1.36 and 1.42%, respectively, during the given
        period. Third, over the given period, a 1% growth in innovation, technical progress`,

        title:`Building Educational Research Capacity: Challenges and Opportunities from the
        Perspectives of Faculty Staff of Selected Private Universities in Uganda`,
        abstract:`This article argues that educational research in Uganda is facing severe glitches,
        such as low research capacity. Most private universities seem to be more focused
        on their day-to-day survival than identifying their research-specific needs and
        engaging in quality research activities. Issues of research capacity-building remain
        a major concern amid a lack of resources and institutional environments in which
        academics work. Capacity-building and research engagements would help to
        strengthen strategic planning and influencing policy. Hence, this study fills this
        gap. Specifically, it explores the perceptions and experiences of academic staff
        regarding research capacity-building. The study identifies the challenges that
        hamper educational research and capacity-building opportunities associated with
        the development of research capacities as perceived by a sample of staff members
        in the identified institutions. To achieve this objective, a qualitative research design
        was adopted using focus group interviews to collect data from a sample of staff. In
        total, 12 focus group discussions were conducted with between 8–10 persons per
        group. Rank ordering of responses on specific issues was done during data analysis.
        The findings showed that the major factors responsible for low research output
        include capacity-building gaps, lack of financial resources, difficulty in identifying
        specific calls for abstracts and manuscripts, work overload for faculty staff, limited
        research writing skills, and bad experiences during previous research engagements,
        as presented and discussed below. Based on the findings, we make the following
        recommendations. First, the government should earmark a significant amount in
        the national budget for research and innovation that institutions in Uganda can
        easily access, including private academic institutions. Second, institutions should
        continuously engage their staff regarding research and improve their research
        capacity through training, workshops and symposiums.`,
