        title:`Role of Higher Education Growth in Enhancing Economic Growth, Innovation
    Advancement and Technological Progress in Uganda (1970–2014)`,
        abstract:`We examine the role of growth in higher education in enhancing economic growth,
        innovation advancement and technological progress in Uganda during the 1970 to
        2014 period. Higher education is measured by the higher (tertiary) education gross
        enrolment ratio (GER). The major hypothesis of the study is that “Higher education
        growth enhances economic growth, innovation advancement and technical
        progress”. The study is important because Uganda still has low levels of higher
        education GER, innovation and technology. Data set employed in the empirical
        analyses was obtained from the United Nations statistics database and analyzed
        using the generalised least squares (GLS) technique. First, we find that a 1% increase
        in higher education GER growth had the potential of causing economic growth,
        innovation advancement, technological progress and total factor (TF) to increase by
        0.82, 0.10, 0.27 and 0.56%, respectively, during the given period. Second, empirical
        evidence shows that a 1% increase in economic growth, innovation advancement,
        technological progress and TF the potential of causing higher education GER
        growth to increase by 1.08, 5.02, 1.36 and 1.42%, respectively, during the given
        period. Third, over the given period, a 1% growth in innovation, technical progress`,
